# 🤖 WhatGPT3

**WhatGPT3** is a simple, responsive frontend website built with **React.js**, created during my **2nd year of college**.  
It provides a clean and visually engaging explanation of **OpenAI’s GPT-3** — what it is, how it works, and its potential applications.

This project focuses on building component-based layouts and modern UI using only frontend technologies.
